              diet, etc. To get temporarily diagnosed at the patientâ€™s ease is 
              what this system does. Disease prediction system is a system 
              which asks few questions related to particular disease and 
              predicts if the person is having that particular disease or not. 
              This system uses Support Vector Machine for prediction purpose 
              of these diseases viz. Hypertension, Diabetes and Thyroid. The 
              accuracy scores over train dataset are 86%, 78%, 96% and over 
              test data are 85%, 77%, 96% respectively."
